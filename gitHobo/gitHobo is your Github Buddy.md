## githobo is your Github Buddy

### what the hell is this markdown thingy anyway?!

gitHobo is a simple text document, like the one you are reading just now; and exactly as in case of this text it is written using Github flavoured markdown. 

so what exactly is this markdown; essentially from end user perspective it is only a little more than plain text. it introduces few additional “tags” which communicate with a server <!--(the server has to be configured for Markdown support)-->    hosting the file and make text cleaner, easier to navigate and a lot easier to reference. it also adds a layer for direct communication of your text with modern web browsers and given we can use some perks of html5 it gives access to quite powerful features

### there are robots in the basement

most importantly though it could open a channel of communication with your IT department and robots from there who seem to be speaking completely different language 

having such possibility could allow for improved feedback loop if not any feedback loop making communication of requirements actually understandable to freaks from there. Why is this important? well

### these robots are powering your web app

some of the robots will be inclined to apply some of the methods and technologies which cropped up recently and which were unavailable before. think of the clouds being a place where robots build cities for themselves 

a text document is all you are looking at when you look at the source of a static web page. 

copy this code 



into a window of any cloud based IDE like codepen and execute the code.

what you will see is a web page of a service available via Gcloud powered by dgs 

### it's all just a very very long text with references to libraries of other very very long text files 

have you seen how long it is though to make up a typical one page web app?

the power of the robotic methods require certain standard and secure handling of data require skills, experience and infrastructure well beyond abilities of any one person with average familiarity with technology 

look at the breakdown of skills a provider of a service to Gcloud would have to consider necessary to cover in order to build a service that could be offered via governmental cloud store 

### here comes the cavalry! don't we just love the industry? 

oh yes we do! long live the queen! now help me plant the explosives! I've covered the pillar on the right and there are some people doing the one on the left I've heard the guys from dgs went to do some more on the other side and i hope they might think of doing something about the civilians 

there are some guidelines we have to follow and as already mentioned you can find a lot of very useful info as well as other materials on pages prepared by dgs team who are doing really great job on the robots side so big kudos in their direction 

in situations where humans or their sensitive data is involved we would all like to make sure those who handle this data know the power at their fingertips 

### so whats the price?

there isn't one. it's all for the lulz, remember? we are all for open, free, inclusive and collaborative methods and we will use the best environment currently around for managing collaborative and powering very complex projects. it's github and all that is required is free GitHub account and ability to use text editor and some of your time 

time and routines prepared with consideration of habitat of both robots and humans are the key to reduce the colatteral damage

### so if there's no “handover date” what are the deliverables?


which you will need to set up your own publishing machinery propped up by secure infrastructure for powering your content

you will also need to learn markdown and according to most who used markdown it should take some 30 seconds of using it to ***get it*** and some 2 minutes to reach the ***master class level of proficiency***


gitHobo is our active response to the feelings we often had that we ourselves have no handle on our own personal data and might not feel as comfortable with technology as the robots to be able to set up the infrastructure anyway, automate the process and make it secure




*in short gitHobo is a bootstrap coming to city hall via calendar app on mayors receptionists smart phone. how more grassroots revolutionary can you get?*

### method for the revolution

in it's communication gitHobo does not concern itself with aims or destinations; it doesn't care where? but how? it is about the process not the aim, its rationale or validity of its initial assumptions.

above being concerned with the process it is however also concerned with participation.

the reason for this is what we consider the most pressing matter and most serious problem for humans as a species 

we consider the following to be true: 

- we are social animals and need each other to live and thrive 
- information exchange from basic body language to most advanced methods used in cryptography forms the basis of any social interaction
- internet and web technologies are the single most advanced form of such social interaction
- it is already evident that we are the internet of things
- there is no possibility of stoping the process of integrating all humans within the network
- level of participation and control in any particular case is however dependant on ability to understand the technology that powers the network and often very complicated processes that are involved
- without this understanding individuals are exposed to abuse and often are unaware of oportunities that are available to them
- in technology dominated reality the rule is simple: "program or be programmed"
- having the knowledge of some of the technologies we see how this is a major problem
- which is why the process becomes crucial as it provides common platform for making decisions that are common to various fields or are cutting through artificially set up lines
- 




ross  on which as a community of experts we can take care of our own field knowing in other fields there are 

our most advanced take on social interaction


which leads to the importance of 

the necesseary  factor the most basic block s for any social interaction
- starting  

the technology and computers in particular are necesseary for basis for recent 

are facing now 


proletarian revolution and there are others who agitate for it as well

however all involved seem to be in agreement gitHobo does not like the idea of monkey purges and bloody revolution style takeovers. beeing what we are, geeky experts in various more or less technical fields we opt for what we were doing all along. set up the machinery in such a way so monkeys can play at the steering wheel still thinking they are driving the bus while we look for solution that would involve as many people as possible and allow for cooperation despite the number and variety of those involved

with this being said gitHobo's short definition states: 

*gitHobo is bootstrap coming to city hall via calendar app on mayors receptionists smart phone. consider this as a challange and try to get more grassroots revolutionary. most of all fork us and let us know about your method*

the chalange is in our view necessery as inherent to geeky culture of continous testing and improvement within a group of coders 



In short it lists steps an editor/writer would have to take from initial idea for a story to final publication of well written and rich in metadata copy for the web.
