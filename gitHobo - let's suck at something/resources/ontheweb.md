As probably already mentioned several times if you want to quickly get up to speed with most recent technologies at minimal cost in terms of time necesseary to get your head around the basics then what you need is ... wait for it ... Google!

Duh, right?

Well not quite, I don't mean [Google the search box](https://www.google.co.uk/) as this would mean casting you out and deeming you to months of aimless wondering without direction in search for higher web dev gnosis.

What I mean is Google's offer and services in much broader sense. The good news is that all you need is google account which is free and in fact you probably already have one, google's own web browser Chrome which you can download in no time and after logging in you are good to go.

and also if stuff done and involve more than one person - that is yourself
