### gitHobo

----------

[gitHobo](https://github.com/weAreThePlayMakers/gitHobo) is a test case for the use of gitHub as a shopping list...

it really boils down to this:

leave a trail of notes whatever you do and you will be okay no matter what. you might even chose to build this web app you've been working on for last few months years whatever.

it really is this simple and the only additional thing you might need is having it accessible on line in somewhat presentable shape.

do not stress too much even though you will get lost in all the chaos. do not make too sudden movements because you might be surprised the feedback you'll get from the environment. most of all make sure you are not overexposed to any person who in their communication with you mentioned two or more times the letters ``p``, ``h`` and ``p`` as if it is a one word and imply to you you need this php in order to acomplish your goals.

you don't. trust me. most of the stuff you could build yourself on your local machine for free during the weekend.

check out meteor apps which are provided as a tutorial files.



 not try to pay for any php people  you don't have the capacity you might be thinking you have
