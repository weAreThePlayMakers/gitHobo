## leaders communicate
---

### any leaders around here? that's what i thought

The aim is to provide you my friend with an easy mthod to adapt to reality of social software development. 

### what does it mean to go "GitHub Commando" 

- as little additional burden as possible; 
- at minimal cost (preferably 0) 
- short sets of instructions
- 20-30 min per day
- for minimum 3 months 

ideally and based on my previous experience whole set should take about 3 months which could be extended for another 3 if projects and individuals involved feel there is a need for more comprehensive training in one area or another. 

### The outcome

those taking part will at the end of 3 months period find themselves with a number of folders on their Dropbox, Google Drive or similar cloud storage service with variety of "unTangible" stuff. The main and most current version of each one of these folders will have its repository on gitHub, with presentable and neat readme.md file. this file written in markdown will explain insides of each folder in a structured manner accessible to coders and everyone else who could see a potential to use their own skills or expertise to enhance any of the projects.

Skills mastered during this time: 

how do you learn heavy duty geekery in a week? 

You don't. 

You make a hard copy of heavy documentation and pay attention to the rule at the back: 

“don't panic” 

just remember to take your towel

## "and now for something completely different"

### what the hell is this markdown thingy anyway?!

gitHobo is a simple text document, like the one you are reading just now; and exactly as in case of this text it is also written with Github flavoured markdown. 

so what exactly is this markdown; essentially from end user perspective it is only a little more than plain text. it introduces few additional “tags” which communicate with the browser and make text cleaner, easier to navigate and a lot easier to reference. 

[check out mastering markdown on gitHub for 3 min long intro][1]

which is why it allows for adding another layer of information and enables your text to communicate directly with modern web browsers and given a lot of new perks provided by modern web tech it could gives access to quite powerful features

### there are robots in the basement

most importantly though it could open a channel for communication with your standard IT departments and robots inhabiting these places traditionally placed in under inhabiting these wo world traditionally from there who seem to be speaking completely different language 

having such possibility could allow for communicating requirements in a way that is machine readible and could be parsed in a robotic manner

### these robots are powering your web app

some of the robots will be inclined to apply some of the methods and technologies which cropped up recently and which were unavailable before. think of the clouds being a place where robots build cities for themselves 

a text document is all you are looking at when you look at the source of a static web page. 

copy this code 



into a window of any cloud based IDE like codepen and execute the code.

what you will see is a web page of a service available via Gcloud powered by dgs 

### it's all just a very very long text with references to libraries of other very very long text files 

have you seen how long it is though to make up a typical one page web app?

the power of the robotic methods require certain standard and secure handling of data require skills, experience and infrastructure well beyond abilities of any one person with average familiarity with technology 

look at the breakdown of skills a provider of a service to Gcloud would have to consider necessary to cover in order to build a service that could be offered via governmental cloud store

there are price tags. and ...

### here comes cavalry! don't we just love the industry? 

"oh yes we do!" "long live the queen! now help me plant the explosives! I've covered the pillar on the right and there are some people doing the one on the left I've heard the guys from dgs went to do some more on the other side and i hope they might think of doing something about the civilians"

### it's all about minimising colateral damage

there are some guidelines we have to follow and as already mentioned you can find a lot of very useful info aas well as other materials on pages prepared by dgs team who are doing really great job on the robots side so big kudos in their direction 

in situations where humans or their sensitive data is involved we would all like to make sure those who handle this data know the power at their fingertips 

## managers colaborate
---

### so whats the price?

there isn't one. we are all for open, free, inclusive and collaborative methods and we will use the best environment currently around for managing collaborative and powering very complex projects. it's github and all that is required is free GitHub account and ability to use text editor and some of your time 

time and routines prepared with consideration of habitat of both robots and humans are the key to reduce the colatteral damage

### so if there's no “handover date” what are the deliverables?


which you will need to set up your own publishing machinery propped up by secure infrastructure for powering your content

you will also need to learn markdown and according to most who used markdown it should take some 30 seconds of using it to ***get it*** and some 2 minutes to reach the ***master class level of proficiency***


gitHobo is our active response to the feelings we often had that we ourselves have no handle on our own personal data and might not feel as comfortable with technology as the robots to be able to set up the infrastructure anyway, automate the process and make it secure




in short gitHobo is a bootstrap coming to the city hall with explosives and demolition equipment via calendar app on the smartphone of mayor's receptionist who happen to be the only constant in mayors dealings with the public. 

can you get more grassroots revolutionary than that?

### so what is the method again and when did we start all these revolutionary proclamations

communicate with your browser are mainly for your browser  (think of them with some simple markup (or tags added to flowchart or a workflow which is a starting point to writing a blog copy.

In short it lists steps an editor/writer would have to take from initial idea for a story to final publication of well written and rich in metadata copy for the web.
