### hey man you are all over my feed recently with your product 
    
    
which at the moment I can't even use yet (I wonder how that works for “viable”) and which resulted in me taking a closer look at your stuff online. you need a website and a proper blog with some well written structured text, that is easy on robots and humans alike with appropriate images etc. 

[here's how it would look like][2] and i am happy to help you with a clean, static site which traditionally i will do for a cheesecake

### you need to think of a plan / editorial strategy 
   
   
and which reinforces your personal/professional brand. think of yourself as being the product and position your initiatives around that product. you could try making personas for these initiatives as well. you will use them as platforms for delivering your content which obviously will have to be related to the character of the initiative and obviously would have to present some value to the target audience.

---
### try to think of a scaled down version of this “system” 
   
   
and build your interactions with your subscribers so they follow your example (you can do it in various ways such as design of user interface of your blogs and web apps). this could become your safety net and might turn any potential fiasco into fairly agreeable success. it would also mean you will have constructive engagement which is the whole point of any of this.

unless you are looking for the holy grail :-) in which case I will only say that it seem to me you have a long way man.

### the tools you will chose may have a tremendous impact on performance
   
   
the point is to enable as many new channels for influx of skills you might be lacking at the moment and maybe are even considering hiring programmers  before there is a need for them at all which might result in you being stuck with high bill for some old school php wizards (not that there is anything wrong with php, wizards or old school. it is the bill you might want to avoid if possible). 

but even if you are lucky, landed a cosy deal and have a sweet budget; do yourself a favour, press pause for a moment and think big picture; and you might find yourself considering the almost abstract problems that [myself][3], [gaia][4] and bunch of other friends came across. 
   
just take a look at this:

### that's when gitHobo comes along 
   
   
together with my co's on [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) we thought we might want to do something about this and are preparing a short crash course on colaborative writing for the web using GitHub as the main repository. it is mainly for the purpose of editorial strategy and workflow as explained above so I hope you'll take the oportunity to learn markdown with us and this version control system thingy everybody on the net is so upbeat about. there are very viable reasons for doing this.

### keeping your stuff open and free on GitHub could be a game changer 
   
   
not only will you be able to get some understanding of how all these web wonders work but also how they are made and this may prop up your entrepreneurial mind in ways neither of us can even imagine. which is the whole point, but the best is that it works both ways because as you will be writing a blog and essentially documenting your initiatives using distributed version control system you will be doing it in a manner that is compatible with open source web dev workflows and in a secure manner. the crowd on GitHub will be able to read your stuff, fork your stuff, build new stuff on top of it and fill in pull requests giving you an option to take your initiatives to a completely new level.

and it's all about new, next level isn't it? we'll speak soon and if you are already on gitHub come and say hello and check out [gitHobo][5], fork it and make it better
